# Topic

I am planning to build an interactive visualization of health insurance coverage rates that will allow users to explore health insurance coverage at the national, state, and (possibly) county-level.

# Data I plan to use

**Race/Ethnicity**

B27001 <br>
&ensp; Types: Only "with health insurance" vs. "no health insurance"
&ensp; Age groups: at 10 year level
&ensp; Breakdowns: Available for each race/ethnicity
&ensp; Estimates: 1-year and 5-year for overall, 1-year only for race/ethnicity groups
&ensp;&ensp; (C27001 has the same with 5-year estimates)
&ensp; https://data.census.gov/table/ACSDT1Y2023.B27001

KFF
&ensp; Uninsured Rates for People Ages 0-64 by Race/Ethnicity
&ensp; Employer-Sponsored Coverage Rates for People Ages 0-64 by Race/Ethnicity
&ensp; Medicaid Coverage Rates for People Ages 0-64 by Race/Ethnicity
&ensp; Health Insurance Coverage of Population Ages 0-64 (overall % in each by state)

**Insurance Type**

B27002-B27009
&ensp; Types: each of "with type" vs. "without type" for Medicaid, public, etc.
&ensp; Age groups: at 10 year level
&ensp; Estimates: 1-year
&ensp;&ensp; (C27002-C27009 has the same with 5-year estimates, less categories)
&ensp; https://data.census.gov/table/ACSDT1Y2023.B27002

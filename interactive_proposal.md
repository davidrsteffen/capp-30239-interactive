# Topic

I am planning to build an interactive visualization of health insurance coverage rates that will allow users to explore health insurance coverage at the national, state, and (possibly) county-level

# Data I plan to use

**Race/Ethnicity**

B27001
&ensp; Types: Only "with health insurance" vs. "no health insurance"
	• Age groups: at 10 year level
	• Breakdowns: Available for each race/ethnicity
	• Estimates: 1-year and 5-year for overall, 1-year only for race/ethnicity groups
		○ (C27001 has the same with 5-year estimates)

KFF
	• Uninsured Rates for People Ages 0-64 by Race/Ethnicity
	• Employer-Sponsored Coverage Rates for People Ages 0-64 by Race/Ethnicity
	• Medicaid Coverage Rates for People Ages 0-64 by Race/Ethnicity
	• Health Insurance Coverage of Population Ages 0-64 (overall % in each by state)

**Insurance Type**
B27002-B27009
	• Types: each of "with type" vs. "without type" for Medicaid, public, etc.
	• Age groups: at 10 year level

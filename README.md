## Description
This project is an interactive visualization of health insurance coverage rates that will allow users to explore health insurance coverage rates for a number of subgroups at the national and state levels.

The first choice a user can make is which topic they are interested in exploring health insurance coverage rates by, between: <br>
&ensp; Income Level and Insurance Type <br>
&ensp; Race/Ethnicity <br>
&ensp; Detailed Insurance Type and Gender <br>

Once a choice has been made, the user can use multiple selection dropdowns based on the topic to select a subgroup of interest, which allows them to explore geographic differences in health insurance rates for that subgroup, including by age group (e.g., <19 vs. 19-34 vs. 35-64).

The national level map then populates and colors based on the health insurance coverage rate for the subgroup the user has selected in each state.

Additionally, as the user hovers over individual states, tooltips display the percentage of the state population in the subgroup with insurance coverage, and how that percentage relates to the national average for the subgroup.

## Data Sources
The primary data source for these analyses was the annual American Community Survey.
These datasets are available at data.census.gov, and are publicly accessible.

Key datasets I used included: <br>
B27018-B27019 for income <br>
B27001 for race/ethnicity <br>
B27002-B27009 for insurance type <br>
